Obese women are 50 per cent more likely to die of breast cancer, research has shown.

Those who are heavily overweight have a higher risk of developing the disease, being diagnosed at a later stage and getting less effective treatment.

A study of almost 3,000 women indicated that breast cancer in obese women was more advanced when diagnosed, with lower survival rates and a higher chance the disease would recur after treatment.

Risk factor: Fat women are more likely to die of breast cancer

Nearly 88 per cent of women who were not obese survived more than five years compared with 83 per cent of obese women, according to Belgian research.

Some 76 per cent of women who were not obese lived for five years without the disease returning, whereas the figure dropped to 70 per cent among obese women.

In total 16 out of 100 obese cancer patients were killed by the disease, compared with 13 out of 100 women of healthier weight.

Another study from Geneva found obese women were 80 per cent more likely to have their cancer diagnosis made at a later stage than non-obese women.

The delay is thought to be down to greater difficulty in finding small lumps. Some women are also embarrassed about their size, which puts them off being examined.

The Geneva Cancer Registry used data on 460 women diagnosed with invasive breast cancer between 2003 and 2005.

It found obese women were 80 per cent more likely to be diagnosed with advanced disease.

It is thought that higher oestrogen levels in obese women&#39;s bodies may play a role in driving the growth of invasive tumours.
