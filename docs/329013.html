<p class="imageCaption">Milk: Health drink or deadly danger?</p>
</div>
<!-- google_ad_section_start(name=s2) -->
<p>Once, it was known as the ultimate health drink. Packed with
vitamins and minerals such as calcium and phosphorous, as well as
all the essential food groups, milk was considered the perfect way
to boost well-being in a glass.</p>
<p>Over recent years, however, scientific evidence has linked
different types of milk to a variety of health scares.</p>
<p>Heather Mills McCartney has this week provoked controversy after
calling on the Government to issue "health warnings" on milk and
dairy products. She believes they play a part in diseases such as
diabetes and some cancers</p>
<p>Swedish researchers have also formerly declared that drinking
more than one glass of milk a day could double the risk of
contracting ovarian cancer.</p>
<p>So just how good for you is milk?</p>
<p><strong>WHOLE COW'S MILK</strong></p>
<p><cite>Calories per pint: 370. Fat per pint: 22 grams.</cite></p>
<p>Cow's milk is packed with a range of nutrients, including
protein, calcium, zinc, vitamins A and B, and iodine.</p>
<p>The National Osteoporosis Society recommends that adults consume
800mg of calcium each day to protect their bones, while growing
teenagers should have 1,000mg.</p>
<p>For many people, milk is as good a source as any of the mineral
- one glass of milk contains 300mg. Only tinned pilchards and
sardines eaten with their bones provide more calcium weight for
weight than milk does.</p>
<p>However, cow's milk has been linked to a number of health
conditions.</p>
<p>One piece of research says women who have more than 90g of fat a
day from sources such as full cream milk are at an increased risk
of breast cancer. This could be because pregnant cows produce
oestrogen, which goes into the milk. Excess oestrogen has been
linked to breast cancer.</p>
<p>This could also explain Japan's low rates of breast cancer -
they prefer soya milk.</p>
<p>Because whole cow's milk is high in saturated fat, it can lead
to heart disease, high cholesterol and even cancer. Milk is also
considered a trigger for eczema.</p>
<p>Anecdotal evidence links drinking milk to increased phlegm
production. It therefore should be avoided by those with
respiratory conditions such as asthma.</p>
<p>Another study linked high consumption of full-fat milk to
increased risk of coronary heart disease in women. Again, this
could be because of its high fat content, which is linked to
elevated cholesterol.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a study in Finland has suggested that children may be
vulnerable to insulindependent diabetes later in life after
exposure to cow's milk - as opposed to breast milk - while very
young. The evidence has not been regarded as conclusive,
however.</p>
<p>Milk needs to be avoided by those who have lactose intolerance -
a deficiency in the body of the enzyme lactose which is needed to
break down and digest dairy products.</p>
<p>Now new Swedish research has linked drinking more than a glass
of milk a day to ovarian cancer. The milk sugar lactose is thought
to over-stimulate the production of hormones, which could encourage
tumours.</p>
<p>This applies not only to fullcream milk, but also to semiskimmed
and skimmed cow's milk.</p>
<p><strong>SEMI-SKIMMED COW'S MILK</strong></p>
<p><cite>Calories per pint: 255. Fat per pint: 9.9
grams.</cite></p>
<p>Semi-skimmed milk is created by skimming cream from whole milk,
producing a more watery liquid. Because the creamy part contains
the fat-soluble vitamin A, it may be necessary to boost intake from
other sources, such as carrots.</p>
<p>Like whole milk, semi-skimmed and skimmed contain valuable
amounts of all the B vitamins, phosphorous and zinc.</p>
<p>However, if you buy milk by the bottle, rather than the carton,
it can lose more than half of its vitamin B2 content if it is left
outside and exposed to daylight.</p>
<p>Those who are intolerant of the milk sugar lactose are
vulnerable to reaction regardless of the type of cow's milk they
drink.</p>
<p><b>SKIMMED COW'S MILK</b></p>
<p><cite>Calories per pint: 195. Fat per pint: 0.5
grams.</cite></p>
<p>Skimmed milk contains 0.1 per cent fat and about half the
calories of the full-fat version. However, even though fat is
removed, it still retains most of its nutrients.</p>
<p>In fact, skimmed cow's milk contains slightly more calcium than
full-fat milk because calcium is found in the watery part, not the
creamy part.</p>
<p>For this reason, women who are post menopausal or who have a
family history of osteoporosis should choose skimmed milk in
preference to whole. It also contains more water- soluble B
vitamins.</p>
<p>But while skimmed milk is a perfect health drink for adults and
is excellent as part of a fatcontrolled diet, it should not be
given to children under five because of its low calorie, fat and
vitamin content.</p>
<p>It is also an excellent alternative to full-cream milk for those
who suffer irritable bowel syndrome, since fat-rich foods are
thought to aggravate the condition.</p>
<p><strong>CHANNEL ISLAND COW'S MILK</strong></p>
<p><cite>Calories per pint: 445. Fat per pint: 28 grams.</cite></p>
<p>Milk from the Channel Islands herds is creamy and much higher in
fat than regular cow's milk.</p>
<p>Ironically, some scientific research has suggested that Guernsey
cows produce a healthier variety of milk.</p>
<p>A study by New Zealand scientists claims that the milk protein
beta- casein A1 - which is not found in milk from Guernsey herds -
could be linked to higher rates of heart disease.</p>
<p>It is not understood exactly why this protein is linked to heart
disease, but scientists found that Finland has the highest
consumption of A1 and has the highest rate of heart disease.</p>
<p>The same protein has also been linked to diabetes, although none
of the studies has been regarded as conclusive.</p>
<p><strong>SOYA MILK</strong></p>
<p><cite>Calories per pint: 205. Fat per pint: 12.6
grams.</cite></p>
<p>Soya milk has long been regarded as the healthy alternative for
those who are intolerant to lactose - the sugar found in cow's
milk.</p>
<p>Research has also trumpeted its many other health benefits.
These include the ability of soya-based products to lower blood
cholesterol levels, helping it protect the heart.</p>
<p>Soya contains isoflavones, which are anti-oxidants thought to
protect the walls of arteries from damage from harmful chemicals
called free radicals.</p>
<p>It also contains a phytochemical substance called geinstein that
is thought to inhibit the formation of blood vessels that assist in
the growth of small tumours. It is for this reason that some
studies have linked the consumption of soya milk to cancer
prevention.</p>
<p><strong>GOAT'S MILK</strong></p>
<p><cite>Calories per pint: 395. Fat per pint: 23.5
grams.</cite></p>
<p>Though goat's milk contains lactose, it can be still be drunk by
those with lactose intolerance (along with sheep and buffalo milk).
No one is quite sure why.</p>
<p>Goat's milk is nutritionally similar to cow's milk.</p>
<p>However, some studies show that it contains a substance that
binds with vitamin B12 to prevent it from being absorbed, and a
vitamin B12 deficiency - with similar symptoms to iron deficiency
anaemia - has been found in some young children fed on it.</p>
<p><strong>RICE MILK</strong></p>
<p><cite>Calories per pint: 278. Fat per pint: 5.6
grams.</cite></p>
<p>Rice milk is usually made from filtered water, brown rice syrup
and brown rice starch, with the addition of thickening agents.
Since it has no animal content, it is a popular alternative for
vegans as well as those who are lactose intolerant.</p>
<p>It is slightly sweeter in taste, but low in fat so it can be
used to replace cow's milk in cooking.</p>
<p>If replacing cow's milk with rice milk in the diet, check that
it has been fortified with calcium, vitamin D and vitamin A.</p>
<p><strong>COCONUT MILK</strong></p>
<p><cite>Calories per pint: 228. Fat per pint: 2.5
grams.</cite></p>
<p>Coconut milk is low in calories. However, it is high in
saturated fat, and so could contribute to high cholesterol or even
heart disease.</p>
<p>A sweet-tasting milk found inside coconuts, it has an acquired
taste and is used less as a drink and more as a delicacy or in
cooking. Its protein content is low, too.</p>
<p>The coconut milk sold in supermarkets is not usually fresh. It
is produced instead by squeezing liquid from grated coconut flesh,
then adding water.</p>
<p>Nutritionally, it is not as good as fresh coconut milk.</p>
