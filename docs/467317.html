<p>Jan Millington has suffered from years of agonising pain caused
by her radiotherapy</p>
</div>
<p>Jan Millington's right arm hangs useless and completely numb by
her side. She often cuts herself without realising it. Recently,
she broke her wrist but found out only after she spotted the
massive bruising.</p>
<p>While there is no feeling in her arm, her right shoulder is
agonisingly painful. The bone in the joint has been weakened and
distorted.</p>
<p>"I have tried every sort of pain relief - from injected
anaesthetic to acupuncture - but nothing really works," says Jan,
67. "I was even prescribed morphine at one point but I couldn't
live with how drowsy it made me feel."</p>
<p>Over the past 15 years, Jan's condition has deteriorated so that
she can no longer drive. Daily life with the use of just one hand
is far from easy.</p>
<p>"Even peeling vegetables presents an almost insurmountable
problem," she says. To add to her problems, damage to her
oesophagus means she finds swallowing food difficult and painful.
What makes her story so tragic is that Jan's injuries were caused
by the very people who were trying to help her beat breast
cancer.</p>
<p>Something went terribly wrong when she was undergoing
radiotherapy - either with the dosage or the administration of
treatment. As a result, Jan is suffering from the irreversible
effects of radiation damage.</p>
<p>She is just one of hundreds of former breast cancer patients
treated in the late 1970s and early 1980s who have been similarly
affected.</p>
<p>"It's been horrendous for all of us," says Jan. "Some women have
had their limbs amputated because damage to the blood supply led to
gangrene; others suffer from ballooned limbs caused by lymphoedema
[water retention-or breathing problems where the radiation damaged
their lungs.</p>
<p>"Some are now living in residential care homes, and all of our
conditions will become progressively worse."</p>

<p>A patient receives radiotherapy treatment</p>
</div>
<p>A few women went on to develop sarcomas - cancers in connective
tissues. Others have died of associated problems such as
respiratory disorders, blood clots, pulmonary embolisms and heart
problems.</p>
<p>The tragic irony is that they were cured of their breast cancer,
but suffered lingering deaths as a result of the treatment.</p>
<p>Their plight made the headlines earlier this year when a coroner
found that 69-year-old Patricia Roper died as a result of delayed
reaction to radiotherapy, 30 years after she was treated for breast
cancer.</p>
<p>Patricia's nerves and blood supply had been damaged by
radiotherapy, and last October her arm was amputated. She died
three weeks after the operation, when her wound haemorrhaged.
However, a post-mortem revealed that the radiation damage had also
fused her internal organs, cutting off the blood supply and causing
chunks of flesh to die off.</p>
<p>Radiation therapy is an integral part of the fight against
cancer and has saved millions of lives. Developed in the 1890s, it
was already being used for the treatment of breast cancer more than
100 years ago.</p>
<p>During the treatment, highenergy radiation from X-rays, gamma
rays, neutrons and other sources are used to bombard the tumour or
the site from where the tumour has been removed, killing active
cancer cells.</p>
<p>Radiation may come from a machine outside the body
(external-beam radiation therapy), or from radioactive material
placed in the body near the cancer site. It is given in conjunction
with surgery, or with surgery and chemotherapy.</p>
<p>Healthy tissue in the vicinity of the cancer will inevitably be
affected, and it is down to the skill and calculations of the
radiologist, and the care of the radiographers who administer and
target that treatment, to keep side-effects to the lowest possible
level.</p>
<p>The damage occurs when the inflammation caused by the treatment
triggers the growth of spiral-like fibres within the nerves and the
blood supply around it.</p>
<p>These fibres grow and harden, eventually damaging the nerve and
cutting off the blood supply - a process which continues for the
rest of the patient's life.</p>
<p>Damage varies with the cancer. Any pelvic-based cancer - for
example, bowel, prostate or gynaecological - often requires high
doses of radiation, and this may lead to serious gastric
side-effects and damage to reproductive or sexual organs.</p>
<p>From the earliest days of radiotherapy cancer treatment,
radiologists knew that it had sideeffects, although it wasn't until
many years later that these were properly documented.</p>
<p>However, there was plenty of anecdotal evidence to cause
concern, and by the 1970s radiologists had started to identify
several ways of reducing the damage.</p>
<p>One was by avoiding high doses of radiotherapy in one treatment
- instead, using smaller doses over a longer period of time.</p>
<p>Today, computers are used to calculate the dosage, and new
machines mean that the radiation is far less damaging to the live
tissue. Nevertheless, although new technology has reduced the risk
of radiotherapy damage, it cannot eradicate it altogether.</p>
<p>It is generally accepted that one to two per cent of all the
thousands of patients undergoing radiotherapy are affected each
year. And the numbers are likely to rise.</p>
<p>Dr Jane Maher, clinical oncologist and chief medical officer for
Macmillan Cancer Support, says: WThe fight against cancer is always
moving forward, and today doctors are willing to treat cancers now
that they perhaps wouldn't have done a few years ago.</p>
<p>"But new treatments can often mean new problems and sideeffects,
so I would not be surprised if the incidence of problems related to
radiotherapy increased."</p>
<p>The fact is that even today although radiotherapy saves lives,
it can also wreak terrible destruction. Yet despite this knowledge,
there is no official register of injuries caused by radiation.</p>
<p>This means that currently there is no way of collating
information, following up affected patients and, most importantly,
picking up any other potential problems.</p>
<p>Without a registration and followup procedure, patients are
often not referred to the people who are qualified to deal with the
damage, such as neurologists and physiotherapists. And early
treatment can make a difference.</p>
<p>"Although there is no cure for radiation damage, physiotherapy
can reduce the severity of the nerve damage," says Karol Sikora,
professor-of cancer medicine and honorary consultant oncologist at
Imperial College School of Medicine, Hammersmith Hospital.
"Properly-managed pain relief also helps.</p>
<p>"In addition, early treatment means patients can be spared much
mental anguish' - the sort of mental anguish Jan and fellow cancer
patients have suffered for more than 25 years.</p>
<p>Ironically, by the time Jan was treated in 1983, radiotherapy
was considered to be relatively low-risk for breast cancer.</p>
<p>After surgeons removed a 2cm lump from her right breast, she
underwent five weeks of radiotherapy. Jan was told she needed 'a
bit of radiotherapy' to catch any stray cancer cells; a kind of
insurance. She was not, she claims, warned about potential
risks.</p>
<p>"I just accepted the treatment and went ahead," she says. "But
within a few weeks, all three sites were incredibly sore and
burnt.</p>
<p>"The skin looked brown and dead, it was agonising to touch, and
my throat hurt when I swallowed. But still, I thought that if it
saved my life and allowed my children - then just 17 and 16 - to
have a mother, then it was worth it.</p>
<p>"I had no idea of the agonies to come. If I had, I would
certainly have thought twice about that treatment," says Jan, who
now has three grandchildren.</p>
<p>She was told that she had every chance of a full recovery, and
in 1985 was confident enough in her future to buy, along with her
husband Bill, now 81, a small girls' prep school in Tunbridge
Wells, Kent.</p>
<p>But in the summer of 1986, Jan started to suffer sporadic sharp
pain and tingling in her right fingers, followed by stiffness in
her right shoulder and neck - classic first symptoms of
radiotherapy damage. A year after the symptoms first appeared, Jan
went back to her radiologist.</p>
<p>"He said I was worrying unnecessarily but agreed to a scan to
put my mind at rest and check for cancer."</p>
<p>A week later, the radiologist called to say that although Jan
didn't have cancer, she appeared to have some scarring from the
radiotherapy which was pressing on nerves and causing the pain in
her arm and neck.</p>
<p>"He said it was rare and I should heal in time," she says.
Instead, the buzzing sensation and pain in her arm became constant
and her hand was beginning to lose strength.</p>
<p>In 1988, she went see her surgeon. "He said he was terribly
sorry but he felt that I might have serious radiation damage. I was
devastated," she says. Still, Jan thought she had been uniquely
unlucky.</p>
<p>"Then, in 1991, I heard about a woman called Lady Audrey
Ironside who'd taken my radiologist and hospital - the Royal
Marsden in London - to court for damages following extensive
radiation injuries, citing medical negligence. What's more, the
news report stated that other women had been damaged as well.</p>
<p>"It was a huge moment for me. I was not alone, nor was I
neurotic or mad. When I confronted the radiologist, he told me his
feelings had been dreadfully-hurt by the court case because he felt
that he was being held responsible for injuries that were purely a
side-effect of the treatment which had saved lives. I sat there
with my useless hand and stiff neck and was speechless."</p>
<p>Jan was just one of hundreds of women from across the country
who wrote to Lady Ironside telling her about their ordeal (in other
hospitals as well as the Royal Marsden).</p>
<p>"We decided to have a meeting," recalls Jan. It was in the house
of the actress Liz Gebhardt, who was severely affected with a
floppy arm and pain. She passed away not long after that, at the
age of just 51.</p>
<p>While it was wonderful to know you were not alone, it was so sad
to see all those damaged women. We decided to form a lobby group -
the Radiotherapy Action Group Exposure (RAGE) to fight for help and
compensation.'</p>
<p>Professor Sikora agrees there were 'undoubtedly mistakes' made
in the administration of the radiotherapy to these women.</p>
<p>"I think it was probably a combination of things that just
happened to line up, with disastrous consequences. The hospitals
where it happened had high workloads, so they were giving higher
doses than normal so that the women didn't have to come in so
often."</p>
<p>Another factor is the shape of the woman's breast.</p>
<p>"Today, the breast shape is part of the computerised calculation
for where the radiotherapy is beamed. In those days, it was mostly
done by human calculation - and, as every breast is different, you
can see how easy it would be to make a small misjudgement."</p>
<p>In order to get compensation, the women started a group action
against several hospitals, but in 1999 this failed. Lacking
meaningful records of the damage and without expert witnesses
prepared to act for the group, a judge deemed the case not strong
enough to go to court.</p>
<p>While this left many of the women devastated - and facing large
legal fees - RAGE has continued to campaign vigorously for better
treatment of patients with radiation damage. It is largely thanks
to RAGE's efforts that vital changes have been made to radiotherapy
treatment generally.</p>
<p>A report funded by the Department of Health into the issue -
after strenuous lobbying from RAGE - led to a series of national
guidelines being laid down in 1995 for the Royal College of
Radiologists to follow, concerning administration and dosage.</p>
<p>Today, radiotherapy is used far less frequently in the treatment
of breast cancer and not at all on lymph nodes. If doctors suspect
cancer has spread to the lymph nodes, they will first surgically
remove them and check for cancer. If it is found, chemotherapy is
offered as a follow-up treatment.</p>
<p>"Like all treatments, including surgery and chemotherapy,
radiotherapy carries side-effects and all patients have a low risk
of damage," says Dr Michael Williams, the vicepresident of the
Royal College of Radiologists.</p>
<p>"The important thing is information, and today guidelines state
you should tell patients about all the risks, even if they are very
rare.</p>
<p>"Twenty or 30 years ago we knew little about the damage
radiotherapy could cause and doctors were more reluctant to tell
patients about treatment risks.</p>
<p>"It probably isn't much comfort to the RAGE ladies, but we did
learn a lot from what happened to them, and because of them,
patient care has changed for the better."</p>
<p>Jan dismisses the suggestion that her injuries were due to a
simple lack of knowledge.</p>
<p>"The medics' argument was that radiotherapy was not an exact
science in those days, that they didn't know enough then to treat
us as safely as they do today," says Jan. "But if that was the
case, why weren't more of the 65,000 or so women who were treated
in that period affected?"</p>
<p>What the group now wants is practical help and support. "Often,
by the time people get to us they are desperate. As we get older,
more ill and less able to fight for ourselves, we need help
now.</p>
<p>"Some of our members have had to move into care homes; others
need help to bathe, drive, or even to prepare a meal. But either
they pay for it themselves or go without.</p>
<p>"We have lobbied MPs and ministers and the Royal College of
Radiologists,' says Jan. "Everyone is very sorry, but no one
actually helps us."</p>
<p>Jane Maher is optimistic that after several years of lobbying,
funding for a pilot scheme of care and assistance is on the cards.
"These things can move slowly," she says. "It can be frustrating
and I understand that. But hopefully a pilot will lead to more
funding for their care."</p>
<p>But the RAGE women feel they no longer have the luxury of
time.</p>
<p>"The reality is that we are all in a bad state and getting
worse," says Jan. "People sometimes say to me: "Well, at least you
are alive." Without the radiotherapy I might have died, but on the
other hand, thousands of women survived breast cancer but didn't
have the dreadful injuries that we do.</p>
<p>"Many of us were young women when we had the treatment - I was
42 - and we have been ill for the best part of 25 years. It is hard
not to feel bitter and angry about our wasted lives. After all
these years of fighting, we have yet to receive any practical help
from anyone.</p>
<p>"We are truly yesterday's women." A spokesperson for the Royal
Marsden Hospital said: "We were unable to find anyone to comment on
this issue at this time."</p>
