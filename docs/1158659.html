<br><p><font size="4">Every Tuesday, Britain's leading nutritionist explains how to eat your way to health. This week Jane explains how dairy products can help with the war on cancer...</font></p><p>We're always being told how important it is to eat at least five portions of fruit and vegetables every day to reduce our risk of cancer. But calcium might offer even better protection; new American research shows it can dramatically cut the risk of bowel, prostate and breast cancer. </p><p>While we all know calcium is good for our teeth and bones, these new findings are a revelation.</p><p>The study, by the National Cancer Institute in America, found men who consumed the highest amount of calcium per day (an average 1,530mg) had a 16 per cent lower risk of developing cancers of the bowel and prostate than those who consumed the lowest amounts (average 526mg).</p><div class="clear"> </div>

<p> </p><p>Meanwhile, women who consumed around 1,881mg of calcium a day had a 23per cent lower risk of breast and bowel cancer than those who consumed 494mg. Both men and women should sit up and take note. </p><p>Calcium works by reducing abnormal cell activity as well as stimulating normal cell growth. The National Cancer Institute has now recommended adults aged 50 or older consume 1,200mg of calcium a day. The UK Food Standards Agency recommends only 700mg a day for adults&nbsp; -&nbsp; something I think must now be reviewed in light of these findings. </p><p>As with any vitamin or mineral, it's better to get it from your diet, rather than taking a supplement. What this new finding suggests is that we should be eating more calcium-rich food. </p><p>Good sources include milk, cheese and other dairy foods, green leafy vegetables such as broccoli, cabbage (particularly dark green varieties) and curly kale, tofu, soya beans, fortified soya milk (and other drinks, such as orange juice with added calcium), nuts, bread, and anything made with fortified flour, such as bread and some breakfast cereals. <br></p><div class="clear"> </div> <div class="floatRHS"> <div class="item">

	</div>	&nbsp; </div><p>The added benefit in dairy foods is that you find other nutrients with potentially anticarcinogenic properties, such as vitamin D and conjugated linoleic acid, an omega-6 fatty acid thought to protect against colorectal and breast cancer. <br> </p> <p>Although dairy products are the best source of calcium, many people avoid them because of the high saturated fat content and calorie count. Indeed, if we tucked into plates of cheese and poured cream on apple pies with buttery pastry all the time, our levels of bad cholesterol would rise, our arteries would be clogged up with plaque and we'd have heart disease. Not to mention putting on weight! <br> </p> <p>This is where low-fat dairy products have an important role, containing just as much, and in some cases more, calcium as the full-fat versions. I'm generally not a fan of low-fat products, as I think they taste worse and can be filled with lots of sugar to compensate for the fat taken out. Also, 'low fat' doesn't mean you won't put on weight&nbsp; -&nbsp; eat too much and you'll still be in trouble. <br></p><p>

</div> </p><p>The answer is tasty low-fat dairy; natural low-fat yoghurt or fromage frais, low-fat cheese (Gouda, Edam and cottage cheese) and of course semi or skimmed milk (it may surprise you to learn the latter has slightly more calcium). <br></p><p>If you want to hit the levels this new study suggests, as a guide you can glean around 1,200mg of calcium from three glasses (200ml) of skimmed milk, a small pot (150g) of low-fat natural yoghurt and 40g of hard cheese (you could swap one of the glasses of milk for a second yoghurt or some cottage cheese).<br></p><p>The alternative is to take a supplement, but discuss this with your doctor, and bear in mind that a pill gives you only one mineral; you miss out on all the other cancer preventing nutrients dairy foods provide, and a pill doesn't taste half as nice!</p><br><p><font style="background-color: rgb(0, 128, 128);" color="#ffffff" size="4">OILY FISH CAN SOOTHE THE PAIN OF PSORIASIS</font><br></p><p><font color="#33cccc" size="4">I suffer terribly from psoriasis. Are there any foods or spices that might aggravate the condition or, alternatively, any that might help, even a little? </font><i>Mary Evans, Doncaster</i><br></p><p><font size="4">Jane says... </font>Psoriasis is a skin condition that leads to very itchy, red, flaky skin lesions. Changing your diet can yield good results, so I think it's well worth a try. <br></p><p>The first, most successful diet change is boosting your intake of something called long-chain omega-3 fatty acids, in particular one called Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). We call them essential fatty acids because we can only get them from our diet: our bodies can't manufacture them so it's essential we eat them. <br></p><p>Although you can get EPA in supplement form, it's far better to get the real thing from food, as it's better absorbed by the body.</p><p>Boost your intake by eating foods containing these omega-3 fatty acids&nbsp; -&nbsp; that means oily fish such as salmon, fresh tuna, sardines, mackerel (2-4 portions a week is the ideal, the smaller amount being considered best for girls and women of childbearing age). <br></p><p>While you can get some omega 3s from walnuts, seeds, hemp or rapeseed oil, they don't provide the beneficial type that helps psoriasis, so you should see them as a useful extra rather than your main omega 3 source. If fish isn't your thing, a supplement is better than nothing&nbsp; -&nbsp; take 500mg of a supplement such as Max-EPA fish oil. With other brands, the dose you are looking for is 500mg EPA/DHA. <br></p><p>Interestingly, some people with psoriasis seem to react badly to gluten, in a similar way to people with coeliac disease&nbsp; -&nbsp; only this time it causes a skin, rather than a gut, reaction.</p><p>See <i>coeliac.co.uk</i> for information on how to avoid gluten containing foods. For extra help, get yourself referred to a dietician who can help you work through the diet.</p><p><br></p><p><font style="text-decoration: underline; color: rgb(51, 204, 204); font-weight: bold;" size="4">GRILLED MACKEREL</font></p><p style="font-style: italic;"><font size="2">SERVES 2</font></p><div class="thinFloatRHS">
