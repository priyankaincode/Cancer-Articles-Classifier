<p>Middle-aged women who drink one glass of wine a night increase
their risk of breast cancer by 60 per cent, an alarming new study
shows.</p>
<p>Up to 2,000 women every year die from alcohol-related breast
cancer, with increasing numbers also suffering from liver cancer
and fertility problems related to drink.</p>
<p>Government guidelines recommend women should drink no more than
14 units of alcohol a week.</p>
<p>But in recent years, the strength of many wines has been
increased and wine glasses enlargened leading to confusion of how
many units of alcohol each glass contains.</p>
<p>Now, a study by the Department of Health - which has not yet
been published - has strongly linked drinking alcohol to breast
cancer.</p>
<p><strong>Scroll down for more...</strong></p>
<div id="ArtContentImgBodyC" style="width:470px;"><img

alt="wine drinkers" width="468" height="303" border="1" />
<p>Women who drink a glass of wine a night are much more likely to
develop breast cancer, according to a new alarming study by the
Department of Health</p>
</div>
<p>The findings show that women who consumed more than the
recommended level of 14 units a week were at least 60 per cent
likely to suffer breast cancer than those who stayed below the
limit.</p>
<p>With one large glass of wine now estimated to be worth the
equivalent of three units, just one per night would add up to more
than 20 units a week. As a result of the study, the government is
launching a &pound;10 million advertising campaign to clamp down on
drinking.</p>
<p>The campaign, which features images such as two wine glasses
with no stems to resemble women&#39;s breasts, aims to educate
women over the health risks associated with their beverage
intake.</p>
<p>It also amounts to an admission from ministers that they have
focussed too much on teenage binge drinkers and need to switch
their attention to the middle classes.</p>
<p></p>

<p>Women drinking more than the recommended 14 units a week were at
least 60 per cent likely to develop the disease</p>
</div>
<p>The initiative, which will be shows on TVs, posters and in
cinemas, will also signal a move towards emphasising the health
impact of drinking instead of focusing almost exclusively to its
links with crime and anti-social behaviour. Public Health Minister
Dawn Primarolo said: &quot;Women who regularly drink too much are
50 per cent more likely to develop breast cancer and many drink too
much simply because they have no idea how many alcohol units they
are consuming.</p>
<p>&quot;They don&#39;t know how many units they are drinking and
they don&#39;t know that, at 3.5 units, that large glass of Rioja
they drank last night actually took them over their daily
amount.</p>
<p>&quot;Professional women who drink too much - but do so without
causing harm to others - have for a long time gone under the
radar.</p>
<p>&quot;But after the campaign no one will be in any doubt as to
how many units they&#39;re drinking and the impact that can have on
their health.&quot;</p>
<p>Stronger wine, varying from 9 per cent to 13 per cent, and
larger glasses, varying from 125ml to 250ml, have led to confusion
over how many units drinkers consume.</p>
<p>A large glass of wine can contain as much as 3.5 units of
alcohol.</p>
<p>Anti binge-drinking campaigns have previously focused on younger
people, but now older women are being targeted.</p>
<p>Health risks for women who binge drink also include a greater
risk of liver disease, unplanned pregnancies and ruptured
bladders.</p>
<p>Last year, a study revealed that one glass of wine or a pint of
beer each day raises the risk of bowel cancer.</p>
<p>The study, of almost half a million people, highlighted a clear
link between alcohol and the cancer which claims 16,000 lives a
year in the UK alone.</p>
<p>It showed that two units - equivalent to a large glass of wine
or a pint of beer - is enough to raise the risk of developing the
disease by 10 per cent.</p>
<p>And the more you drink, the greater the threat.</p>
<p>Two pints a day, or two large glasses of wine, increases the
risk by a quarter.</p>
<p>Another study showed that three or more alcoholic drinks a day -
whether beer, wine or spirits - raises a woman&#39;s risk of breast
cancer by as much as 30 per cent.</p>
<p>Women who drank between one and two alcoholic drinks per day
increased their risk of breast cancer by ten per cent compared with
those who consumed less than one drink each day, the American
researchers found.</p>
<p>The risk jumped by 30 per cent in women who consumed more than
three drinks a day.</p>
