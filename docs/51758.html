<p>A U.S. jury has awarded a cancer-stricken smoker more than $3
billion from a tobacco giant - the largest judgment against a
cigarette maker in a lawsuit brought by an individual.</p>
<p>The Superior Court jury yesterday found against Philip Morris on
all six claims of fraud, negligence and making a defective product.
Some legal experts cautioned, however, that the award might not
stand.</p>
<p>Richard Boeken, 56, was awarded $3 billion in punitive damages
and $5.5 million in general damages.</p>
<p>"We thought that figure would hurt them, make them stand up and
take notice," juror Denise Key said of the punitive damages. "We
want them to be responsible, to put on their product that the
product will kill so when you smoke you smoke at your own
risk."</p>
<p>It was the largest jury award won by an individual against a
cigarette maker. The largest judgment against the tobacco industry
in a class-action lawsuit was $145 billion awarded last year to
thousands of sick Florida smokers.</p>
<p>Philip Morris was one of five tobacco companies in that
case.</p>
<p>Boeken, who suffers from incurable lung cancer, smiled and gave
a thumbs-up sign as the 18-page verdict was read. He declined to
speak to reporters after the hearing.</p>
<p>Philip Morris lawyer Maurice Leiter said he will appeal.</p>
<p>"We recognize Philip Morris is an unpopular company. It makes a
dangerous product, but clearly, the evidence does not support this
verdict," Leiter said.</p>
<p>He said the company believes Boeken ignored "a mountain of
information" about the health risks of smoking and chose to
continue his habit.</p>
<p>Boeken's lawyer, Michael Piuze, said he did not know how the
jury set the award amount.</p>
<p>"I don't know where it came from, but we're pleased," Piuze
said.</p>
<p>The award may not pass a new test adopted by the U.S. Supreme
Court, some legal experts warned.</p>
<p>"The punitive damage award has to bear some relationship to
compensatory damage," said Michael Hausfeld, who sued tobacco
companies in May, claiming they violated federal racketeering laws
to hook children on cigarettes.</p>
<p>"Clearly here the punitive award is an expression of total
outrage and I'm not sure under the Supreme Court test for a single
individual that kind of a differential would be upheld," Hausfeld
said.</p>
<p>Boeken had sought more than dlrs 12 million in compensatory
damages such as medical bills and lost earnings, and between dlrs
100 million and dlrs 10 billion in punitive damages.</p>
<p>He was diagnosed in 1999 with lung cancer, which has spread to
his lymph nodes, back and brain. He took up cigarettes in 1957 at
age 13 and was smoking at least two packs of Marlboros every day
for more than 40 years.</p>
<p>Piuze said his client had kicked heroin and alcohol, but renewed
his smoking habit after trying to quit several times.</p>
<p>Piuze argued that his client was a victim of a decades-long
tobacco industry campaign to promote smoking as "cool" while the
company concealed the serious dangers of smoking.</p>
<p>During closing arguments, Piuze said Philip Morris is "the
world's biggest drug dealer, something that puts the Colombian drug
cartels to shame."</p>
<p>Lawyers for Philip Morris didn't deny that smoking caused
Boeken's illness but argued that he ignored health warnings about
the dangers of cigarettes and chose to smoke despite the risk.</p>
<p>The jury began deliberations on May 22. Jurors during the
seven-week trial were presented with evidence that included company
memos and videotaped depositions from Boeken and clips of tobacco
company executives' 1994 congressional testimony.</p>
<p>Juror Ann Anderson said her intent was not punish the
company.</p>
<p>"I think in the jury room a lot of people thought we wanted to
punish Philip Morris," she said. "It wasn't to punish them. It was
to make them stand up and take notice."</p>
<p>The verdict was the latest in a series of tobacco industry
courtroom losses. Earlier this week, a New York City jury found
tobacco companies liable for deceptive business practices, ordering
them to pay up to $17.8 million to treat ailing New York
smokers.</p>
<p>There have been six earlier cases in which plaintiffs won
individual awards since the mid-1990s, said Richard Daynard, a law
professor and chairman of the Tobacco Products Liability Project at
Northeastern University School of Law in Boston.</p>
<p>But only one of those plaintiffs has actually received any
money, a 70-year-old ex-smoker who got $1.1 million from Brown
&amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp. after a 1995 jury award. The company
is appealing the verdict to the Supreme Court, but was ordered to
make the payment.</p>
<p>Shares of Philip Morris finished regular trading Wednesday at
$50, down 83 cents. In after-hours trading, shares fell $1.75 to
$48.25.</p>
