<p>Rosie and Stephen, both in their mid-40s, live with their son
James, aged 12, in a bungalow in Cardiff. The couple run a training
consultancy and James goes to school, plays rugby and rides his
bike with his mates.</p>
<p>So far, so straightforward. But Stephen has no legs and Rosie
has no limbs at all - only four fingers attached to her shoulders,
and feet with 13 toes.</p>

border="1" />
<p>Rosie was a happy little girl despite her disabilities and her
parents made sure she lived as normal life as possible</p>
</div>
<p>Rosie and Stephen are ?thalidomiders? - two of the 10,000 or so
people worldwide born in the early Sixties to mothers who took the
?completely safe anti-morning sickness pill thalidomide. Now, the
couple are watching with increasing discomfort as momentum grows
for the re-introduction of thalidomide as a licensed drug in this
country.</p>
<p>The Lancet has just reported that thalidomide may help increase
life expectancy in older people with the incurable blood cancer
multiple myeloma.</p>
<p>Thalidomide is already being used by at least 13,000 people in
Europe, on a special ?named patient? basis. But Pharmion, the
company that distributes the drug in Europe (and supported the
research) has applied for a licence, which means regulation would
be less stringent and the number of users would substantially
rise.</p>
<p>For those affected by the thalidomide disaster, the idea of a
new licence for the drug is a dilemma, says Rosie. On the one hand,
she has no desire to deny anyone a drug that might help them. On
the other, she doesn?t want to see the birth of another generation
of thalidomide impaired people.</p>
<p>It would be hard to find a more positive human being than Rosie,
but life as one of the 450 surviving British thalidomiders hasn'?t
been easy. As she explains in her new book, Rosie was born with the
classic impairment, phocomelia (Greek for ?seal-limbed?).</p>

<p>A life of triumph against all odds: Rosie Moriarty-Simmonds</p>
</div>
<p>Her parents were immediately pressured by doctors and priests to
put her in an institution - the fate of nearly half of all
thalidomide children. On one occasion, her mum and dad reached the
gates of an orphanage with Rosie in their arms, but quickly turned
back. ?Standing outside this palatial, gloomy building, they paused
and, without even saying a word to each other, turned and took me
back home,? she says.</p>
<p>Even so, she spent much of her early life in hospital undergoing
operation after operation. ?On seeing an imperfect body, doctors
feel compelled to try to make it more like the norm,? says Rosie.
?From a personal point of view, it would have been more comfortable
had I been found by an archaeologist - at least they preserve
damaged goods!? The doctors were insistent. It wasn'?t just
operations but artificial limbs - the ?mechanical paraphernalia
constantly being ?wired, bolted and screwed? painfully to her body,
recalls Rosie.</p>
<p>So unsteady did some of the lower limb contraptions make Rosie
and her peers, that ?the doctors solicitously fitted us with crash
helmets, transforming us into ?"Metal Mickeys", a process that
rather defeated their purpose of making us less conspicuous?.</p>
<p>She was also fitted with compressed-air arms. Powered from a
canister strapped to her back, they were a nightmare to manipulate:
"?The doctors failed to notice I could perform all the tasks much
quicker and more easily using the resources nature had provided me
with."</p>
<p>Just one good thing came out of all the limb fittings she
attended - she met a little boy who was being fitted with
prosthetic legs. His name was Stephen.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, at home Rosie was never made to feel particularly
different. Her sisters pushed her around in her wheelchair and her
parents ensured that whatever the family did, Rosie did too.</p>
<p>Only much later did she realise just how hard this must have
been, especially as the family had little money. Rosie wonders now
whether the strain - along with misplaced guilt - contributed to
her mother's early death at just 49.</p>
<p>Thalidomide was withdrawn in 1961, but it was not until 1968 -
after a long court battle in which the parents brought a class
action - that compensation was agreed. Rosie, then aged eight,
remembers being "?paraded before a panel of ?experts" - mostly men
- stripped to my underpants? - for a compensation assessment.</p>
<p>?"We were expected to ?"do tricks" - walk, do this, do that. Of
course, we did our very best and really tried to show what we could
do, when really we should have been showing what we couldn'?t."</p>
<p>The revelation of the cause of her impairments turned Rosie from
an apparent freak of nature to victim of medical error, she says,
and led to some specially organised holidays and outings. Many
people were sympathetic too, but not everyone.</p>
<p>On one occasion, Rosie?'s youngest sister, Denise, pushed her to
a corner shop and parked her inside the door because the aisle was
too narrow for the wheelchair. The shopkeeper seized the chair and
started pushing Rosie out of the door and down the huge step
without tilting the chair back. Denise just managed to grab the
chair and Rosie?s hair before she hit her face on the pavement.</p>
<p>"?Nowadays I'?d have that shopkeeper in court,"? says Rosie, who
runs her own disability issues consultancy, training in disability
equality and best practice. Things aren't perfect, even now, she
says, but attitudes have improved a great deal. Shopping is no
longer a minefield, although it can be interesting.</p>
<p>"?I was in Asda once and felt this tickling sensation. I looked
down and this little girl was smiling up at me with her hand up my
sleeve. She was trying to find my arm."? Rosie didn?t mind.
Children need their questions answered, she says, "?and they often
ask the questions adults would like to ask. For instance: "?Can you
pick your nose?" Yes; "?How do you eat" I can feed myself but I
need the food cut up."</p>
<p>Rosie has a personal assistant who comes each morning to help.
At other times, Stephen is there. But James learnt early to keep
his toys tidy - a wheelchair over a toy is not good for the toy.
Otherwise, he lives quite a normal life.</p>
<p>The idea that he should be involved in his parents? care fills
Rosie with horror. "?My worst nightmare,"? she says. ?"Never, that
is not something he should ever have to do."? James is Rosie?s
pride and joy.</p>
<p>After three miscarriages she had begun to wonder whether she?'d
suffered internal damage, as was the case with some
thalidomiders.</p>
<p>Longer-term health implications are not clear; of the 500
thalidomiders born in this country, some ten per cent have died
before the age of 50 - two of them Rosie?'s friends.</p>
<p>While their deaths probably weren'?t directly attributable to
thalidomide, she says they may have been indirectly related. It is
easy to forget, for instance, the difficulty of quickly inserting
an emergency drip in someone who has no limbs.</p>
<p>Rosie is, naturally, very cautious about all things medical: "?I
try to avoid doctors, hospitals and especially medication - though
I have to take some, of course."</p>
<p>She reads all the small print, and while pregnant with James
wouldn?'t take anything beyond a couple of paracetamol, even
refusing gas during labour. "?I wasn?t taking any chances,"? she
says.</p>
<p>Fortunately, James arrived with everything intact. Stephen, a
solicitor, worked from home two days a week so he could lend a
hand, and they employed a mother'?s help for the other three days
(paying her themselves, not relying on social services).</p>
<p>Rosie had to be inventive - using her teeth to lift James ?"with
a mouthful of Babygro?", and holding a long spoon (two baby spoons
Sellotaped together) to feed him. She could change a nappy in an
emergency.</p>
<p>Stephen and Rosie are determined to make the most of their lives
and give James as normal an upbringing as possible - and they seem
to be succeeding on both fronts. But there is no denying that it is
hard, which is why they view the return of thalidomide with
trepidation. Their fears are not idle. In Brazil - where the drug
is used to alleviate the side-effects of leprosy treatment - 33
thalidomiders were born between 1969 and 1995. There were
precautions in place to prevent pregnant women taking the drug, but
?drugs leak into the general population,? says Dr Claus Newman of
the Thalidomide Trust.</p>
<p>"?If a medicine seems to work then it will be passed from person
to person, especially in a huge and relatively under-educated
population such as Brazil?s, and the warnings may not go with
it."</p>
<p>Dr Newman adds: "Thalidomide is an unforgiving substance. It
only requires one tablet to be taken in the most sensitive period
[20-36 days after conception] to almost guarantee damage to the
baby."</p>
<p>The Pharmion Risk Management Programme - aimed at preventing any
unborn child coming into contact with Thalidomide - requires women
of child-bearing age to use two forms of contraception and have a
pregnancy test every four weeks while on treatment.</p>
<p>As the drug has been found in semen, men must also use a condom
during and for four weeks after treatment. Doctors prescribing
thalidomide and pharmacies dispensing it, have to be registered
with the drug company and patients are provided with material about
the dangers of thalidomide - including an interview with a
thalidomidedamaged person - before they can sign that they
understand the risks.</p>
<p>?If the scheme is rigidly and skillfully enforced, it should
indeed minimise the risks,? says Dr Newman, ?but you can?t
legislate for human folly or ignorance.?</p>
<p>The current licence application is for the treatment of multiple
myeloma. Most MM patients are over 65 and the majority are men, but
Rosie fears that if a licence is granted for one disease, others
will soon follow.</p>
<p>Researchers are looking at thalidomide for a wide range of
immune system diseases, cancers and AIDS-related disorders.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Pharmion is not the only producer of the drug.
Others are making it and selling it - sometimes via the internet -
with no safety procedures in place.</p>
<p>Rosie would prefer to see the drug continue to be used on the
present, closely supervised, "?named patient" basis, rather than it
receiving a standard licence. ?"I would love to see this drug that
has done so much harm, do some good,?" she says. "?But I can'?t
help seeing it as an accident waiting to happen.?"</p>
