<p>Milk and dairy products may be tainted by cancer-causing
chemicals from foot-and-mouth pyres, Government experts warned
yesterday.</p>
<p>Scientists fear smoke from the infernos carried dioxins on to
pasture grazed by dairy cattle.</p>
<p>Dioxins have been linked to illnesses including cancer and
diabetes, as well as behavioural problems in children.</p>
<p>The Food Standards Agency, which issued the warning, stressed
that there was no evidence yet of a dioxin build-up, and that only
a very few people would be at risk in any case.</p>
<p>But there were fears that the warning may prompt consumers to
boycott milk, with potentially disastrous results for both public
health and the embattled industry.</p>
<p>A drop in milk sales could be the final blowfor many farmers
already reeling from the disasters of BSE and foot-and-mouth.</p>
<p>Cutting out milk could have particular health implications for
babies and children who benefit from the calcium and protein it
contains.</p>
<p>Only milk and milk products which come directly from herds
grazing within a mile and a quarter of pyres are under
suspicion.</p>
<p>Dioxins are most likely to be prevalent in fatty products such
as whole milk, cream, soft cheese and yoghurt.</p>
<p>The FSA has yet to see the results of tests for dioxins in
affected areas, but chairman Sir John Krebs said it was following a
policy of openness, in contrast to previous official silences over
health threats.</p>
<p>The agency advised those most likely to be at risk - mostly farm
families and people who buy direct from farms - that they could
switch to low-fat alternatives like skimmed or semi-skimmed
milk.</p>
<p>Most milk drunk in the UK is produced by large dairies which
combine the milk from a variety of herds, so dioxins from any farm
at risk would be massively diluted.</p>
<p>Any dioxins released from pyres would have come mainly from the
chemically-treated railway sleepers used to accelerate many of the
fires.</p>
<p>Fuel and other materials used to burn carcasses may also have
released dioxins.</p>
<p>Testing for dioxins began three weeks ago at farms within two
kilometres (1.24miles) of pyres - the area in which ash mostly
settles.</p>
<p>Samples have been collected from sites in Devon, South and North
Wales, Dumfries and Galloway and Cumbria, but the results will not
be known until the end of next month.</p>
<p>The FSA has written to half the country's 30,000 dairy farms,
although only some 900 in potential risk areas are affected by the
agency's advice to alert their customers. Sheep milk products could
also be affected.</p>
<p>In the past, Government agencies have tended not to issue
warnings until there was firm evidence of a risk. But that led to
cover-up allegations over both BSE and foot-and-mouth.</p>
<p>Sir John said: 'Traditionally, what Government has done is keep
people in the dark until there is a problem.</p>
<p>'We thought if we said nothing until the end of June and it
turned out the levels of dioxins were higher than expected, people
would begin to ask us when we started asking these questions. 'We
think that is a bigger risk than saying what is actually happening
and allowing people to make their own choices.</p>
<p>'We realise that there is a risk people may over-react but our
approach is that people have a right to know what we know and when
we know it.'</p>
<p>The timing of the warning is also due to the fact that thousands
of dairy herds have recently been turned out to summer
pastures.</p>
<p>But Sir John stressed: 'This is highly precautionary advice for
a very small number of consumers. We are saying it is unlikely
there will be a risk from milk, but that we cannot be absolutely
sure until we have completed our tests.'</p>
<p>He added that dioxins are harmful only after exposure spanning
many years, rather than a few weeks.</p>
<p>Charles Secrett, executive director of Friends of the Earth,
said the agency's advice was a welcome sign of openness.</p>
<p>He said: 'Congratulations to the FSA for beginning to live up to
its promise to be an independent food safety body - but it is yet
more worrying news for farmers and families in foot-and-mouth
areas.</p>
<p>'The Government must give a full account of its handling of the
foot-and-mouth crisis to a public inquiry.</p>
<p>'We need to know why the Agriculture Ministry did not follow
Environment Agency recommendations on the safe disposal of
carcasses.'</p>
<p>Mr Secrett said the safest methods were rendering, burning in
licensed incinerators and using landfills.</p>
<p>The milk warning came as officials tried to ease concerns that
water supplies near foot-and-mouth burial sites could be
contaminated with BSE.</p>
<p>Professor Peter Smith, chairman of the Government's Spongiform
Encephalopathy Advisory Committee, said any increased risks were
likely to be 'very small' and associated with drinking water over a
long period.</p>
<p>The Department of Health said risk assessments would be
undertaken at burial sites.</p>
<p>The chance of a person contracting vCJD from water contaminated
by buried ash is estimated to be one in a million. That increases
sixfold where carcasses are buried.</p>
<p>Up to 10,000 of the culled animals are believed to have been
over five years old, the category of the highest BSE risk.</p>
